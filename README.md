This program was done as a coding exercise for Lumen by Thomas Marion on
December 2nd 2020.

To run this program, assuming python3 is installed, make sure there is a
csv file of the discussed format (parent_id,node_id,node_name|...) named
"input.csv" in the same directory. Navigate to this directory in the
console. This was tested with python3 using the command:

"python3 ./exercise.py".

In addition to the sample data, it was designed to handle data that is not
arranged in any specific order (such as ascending node_id) so hopefully 
you can play around with it!
